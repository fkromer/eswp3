ESWP³ - Embedded Software Principles, Procedures and Patterns
=============================================================

This project is about summarizing, referencing, structuring and relating
principles, procedures (as sequences of patterns in a pattern language) and
patterns in the context of embedded software engineering.

As "(P)atterns are only meaningful as part of a Pattern Language(.)" (Bergin
2013, pos. 74) this project tries also to "make" relations between different
pattern languages and the higher-level principles "visible".
