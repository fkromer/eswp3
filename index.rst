Welcome to the ESWKMS
=====================

Inspired by the idea of a "pattern system" this website collects references to patterns, principles and procedures in the context of embedded software engineering.

"A pattern system for software architecture is a collection of patterns for software architecture, together with guidelines for their implementation, combination and practical use in software development." (Buschmann et al. 2001, chapter "5.1 What is a Pattern System?")
