ESWP3 - Embedded Software Principles, Procedures and Patterns
=============================================================

This project is about summarizing, referencing, structuring and relating
principles, procedures (as sequences of patterns in a pattern language) and
patterns in the context of embedded software engineering.

As "(P)atterns are only meaningful as part of a Pattern Language(.)" (Bergin
2013, pos. 74) this project tries also to "make" relations between different
pattern languages and the higher-level principles "visible".

MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE:

I am playing around with some generic principle, pattern language and pattern mining project in my spare time here https://github.com/fkromer/p3 . Feel free to contribute and to join the journey of making pattern management public and as easy as possible.
