Procedures are meant to be pattern languages. They shall point out how to apply
several patterns of different levels of scope to solve a high-level problem in a
sequential manner considering the balancing of forces which are influenced. 


Categorization of procedures
============================

The most obvious categorization scheme for procedures is related to the scope of
optimization (~ pattern categories):

* human relation pattern procedures
* build pattern procedures
* requirement pattern procedures
* design pattern procedures
* unit test pattern procedures
* tool pattern procedures
