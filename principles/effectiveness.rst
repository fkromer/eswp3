Effectiveness
*************

:Context:
 - someone else (or yourself) discovers that the achieved result is not as high
   as the target was defined to be

:Problem:
 - either the result is too low or the target definition to high

:Forces:
 - circumstances
 - definition of the target (attributes ~ SpecificMeasurableAchievableRelevantTimely) 

:Solution:
 - analyze the impact of the circumstances
 - analyze the quality of the target definition
 - if the circumstances and the target definition do have an impact that
   excuses the decreased/low effectiveness:
   explain which circumstances are relevant or which target definition attributes
   are relevant and why they do impact the effectiveness
 - if the circumstances and the target definition do not have an impact that
   excuses the decreased/low effectiveness:
   - analyze if you "Do the right things.":
     - no: change your methodology!
     - yes: you can try to compensate the lack of effectivness
            by increasing the efficiency

:Resulting context:
 - you have to argue either way
 - try to increase the efficiency applying the pattern **efficiency**
