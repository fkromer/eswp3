Efficiency
**********

:Context:
 - you did have already applied **effectivness**
   (Do never apply **efficiency** before **effectivness**!!!)
 - someone else (or yourself) figures out that the output in a given time
   and under unchanged circumstances is not as high as it could be related
   to a comparable "standard"

:Problem:
 - either the result is too low or the effort too high

:Forces:
 - circumstances

:Solution:
 - analyze the impact of the circumstances
 - if the circumstances do have an impact which excuses the decreased/low efficiency:
   explain which circumstances are relevant and why they do impact the efficiency
 - if the circumstances do not have an impact which excuses the decreased/low efficiency:
   "Do the things right." (Do not mix this with **effectivness**.)

:Resulting context:
 - you do have to argue either way
 - to do the things right:
   - you need to invest energy initially
   - you might need to invest energy continuoulsy
   - your efficiency is increased
