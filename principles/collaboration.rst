Collaboration
*************

:Context:
 A problem influences at least one individual.

:Problem:
 The problem complexity or the work that has to be done to overcome the problem
 requires a lot of energy invest for the individual or can not be solved by an
 individual at all.

:Solution:
 Individuals which are influenced by the problem solve the problem together in a
 cooperative manner. Individuals which are not affected by the problem may
 contribute to the problem solving as well.

:Resulting context:
 The directly affected individual has to invest less energy to solve the problem
 or the problem is solveable in general. The individuals which are not influeced
 by the problem benefit from the collective somehow. There energy invest is less
 than their benefit from the collective. To manage the collaboration of the
 individuals additional communication of the individuals is required. The
 problem can be divided into managable subproblems by applying the principle
 "divide and conquer" (context domain, time domain, etc.).
