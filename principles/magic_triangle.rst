********************************************
Magic Triangle (Project Management Triangle)
********************************************

Projects are constraint by three (plus one) attributes:
- cost
- scope / features
- schedule
- (quality)

The attributes cost, scope and schedule represent the corners of the triangle.
The attribute quality represents the area which is span by the triangle.

:Problem:
expecting a constant quality, one of the other attributes can not be changed
without affecting the others (e.g. scope increases/decreases ->
cost or schedule increases/decreases)

:Resulting context:
- expecting a constant quality the following combinations are possible:
  - Fast and Much (not Cheap)
  - Fast and Cheap (not Much)
  - Much and Cheap (not Fast)

- ... or if quality is included in scope/features the following combinations are possible:
  - Fast and Good (not Cheap)
  - Fast and Cheap (not Good)
  - Good and Cheap (not Fast)
