Requirement Patterns
********************

"Good" requirements have the following characteristics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement):

- unitary

- complete

- consistent

- non-conjugated

- traceable

- current

- unambiguous

- specify importance

- verifiable

Standardized Textual Specification Pattern
------------------------------------------

A standardized textual description of a requirement helps to satisfy that requirement is unitary, complete, non-conjugated, verifiable.

Perform Manual Review Pattern
-----------------------------

A manual review verifies that a single requirement is unambiguous and specifies importance. In addition it verifies that the requirement characteristics pointed at with the "Standarized Textual Description Pattern" (unitary, complete, non-conjugated, verifiable) are satisfied.
