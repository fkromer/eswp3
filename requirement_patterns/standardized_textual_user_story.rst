Standardized Textual User Story
*******************************

:Context:
 A textual representatioon of a user story does not point out the important
 issues "who", "what" and "why".

:Solution:
 Formulate the user story in standardized grammar format.

:Implementation example:
 "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>. ... As a Database
 Administrator, I should be able to revert a selected number of database updates
 so that the desired version of the database is restored."(ISTQB Agile Tester
 Lesson 1 of 3, section "Format for creation of User Stories"/pos. 240).

:Resulting context:
 It is more obvious **who (role)** is interested in the user story, **what
 (goal)** the user story shall address and **why (benefit)** it makes sense to
 be addressed.
