Python Exception Handling
=========================

:Context:
 - develop new application
 - maintenance of legacy application with bad debug-ability
 - maintenance of legacy application with bad logging capabilities
 - maintenance of legacy library/framework with bad useability

:Problem:
 - communication of unusual circumstances/error conditions
 - propagation of error conditions 
 - handling of error conditions without using input parameter checks

:Solution:
 - use the built-in exception handling features (try:, except:, etc.)

:Resulting context:
 - increased debug-ability
 - increased logging capabilities
 - increased useability of libraries/frameworks for client programmers
 - insignificant overhead
