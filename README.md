# ESWP³

## About

The [ESWP³](http://eswp3.readthedocs.io) is about summarizing, referencing, structuring and relating principles, procedures (as sequences of patterns in a pattern languages) and patterns in the context of embedded software engineering.

Almost 700 happy readers all over the planet can´t be wrong.

**ESWP3** uses the python module **p3** (beta status) as sub project (eswp3/p3/). **p3** is a graphical pattern language processor. Visit the [project wiki](https://github.com/fkromer/eswp3/wiki) for further information.

## Migration to P3

**I am setting up a new generic infrastructure ([p3](https://github.com/fkromer/p3)) for pattern mining projects and graphical representation of pattern languages. I am looking forward to use it for my current and coming private minings. But the infrastructure is Open Source. It is implemented in JavaScript (Node.js, meanjs.org MEAN stack). Feel free to contribute to it.**

## How to contribute

Have a look into the [project wiki](https://github.com/fkromer/eswp3/wiki) for details about how to contribute to the project.
But if you can´t or don´t want to setup the Python environment on your PC feel free to send me references to patterns (software design, etc.) per mail (thinwybk@mailbox.org).
