Container Pattern
=================

Abstracts away data structuring from application domain classes.

:Implementation example:
 C++ - The Standard Template Library (STL) as part of the ANSI C++ provides many
 container and iterators.

:Model example:
 Generic model example with client (user of parts), iterator (mediates access to
 parts, inserts/delets parts), container (manages part collection, provides access
 operations) and two parts (data) (Douglass 1998, p. 271).
