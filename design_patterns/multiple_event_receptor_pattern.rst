Multiple Event Receptor Pattern
*******************************

Handling of synchonous events from a single event server using an event receptor for each event (multiple event receptor finite state machine).

:Implementation example: C - Tokenizer for floating point number strings implemented as synchronous state machine with events (digit, white space, dot, end of string) triggered by the client (Douglass 2011, chapter 5.4.8).
