 living in systems pattern

:Solution:

 - expose your assumptions about the system visible to others and yourself (self-reflection!)
  - need to be complete
  - need to add up
  - need to be consistent
 - invite others to challenge your assumptions
 - invite others to add their assumptions to yours
 - collect as many assumptions as possible
 - consider all to be plausible until you are evident to rule some out
