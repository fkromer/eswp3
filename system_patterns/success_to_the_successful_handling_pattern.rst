Success To The Successful Handling Pattern
******************************************

:Problem:
 If the winners of a competition are systematically rewarded with the means to in again, a reinforcing
 feedback loop is created by which, if it is allowed to proceed unihibited, the winners eventually take all,
 while the losers are eliminated.

:Solution:
 Diversification, which allows those who are losing the competition to get out of that game and start another
 one; strict limitation on the fraction of the pie any one winner may win (antitrust laws); policies that level
 the playing field, removing some of the advantage of the strongest players or increasing the advantage of the
 weakest; policies that devise rewards for success that do not bias the next round of competition.
