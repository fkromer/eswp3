Rule Beating Handling Pattern
*****************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 Rules to govern a system can lead to rule-beating - perverse behavior that gives the appearance of
 obeying the rules or achieving the goals, but that actually distorts the system.

:Situation:
 Design, or redesign, rules to release creativity not in the direction of beating the rules, but in
 the direction of achieving the purpose of the rules.
