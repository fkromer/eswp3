Seeking The Wrong Goal Handling Pattern
***************************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 The system behavior is particularly sensitive to the goals of feedback loops. If the goals -
 the indicators of satisfaction of the rules - are defined inaccurately or incompletely, the system
 may obediently work to produce a result that is not really intended or wanted.

:Situation:
 Specify inidicators and goals that reflect the real welfare of the system. Be especially careful
 not to confuse effort with result or you will end up with a system that is producing effort, not result.
