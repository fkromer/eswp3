Tragedy Of The Commons Handling Pattern
***************************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 When there is a commonly shared resoure, every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the costs
 of its abuse with everyone else. Therefore, there is very weak feedback from the condition of the resource
 to the decisions of the resource users. The consequence is overuse of the resource, eroding it until it
 becomes unavailable to anyone.

:Solution:
 Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource.
 And also restore or strengthen the missing feedback link, either by privatizing the resource so each user
 feels the direct consequences of its abuse or (since many resources cannot be privatized) by regulating the
 access of all users to the resource.
