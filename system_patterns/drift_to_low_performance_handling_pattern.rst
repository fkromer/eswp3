Drift To Low Performance Handling Pattern
*****************************************

:Problem:
 Allowing performance standards to be influenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative
 bias in perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals that sets a
 system drifting toward low performance.

:Situation:
 Keep performance standards absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual performance
 instead of being discouraged by the worst. Set up a drift toward high performance!
