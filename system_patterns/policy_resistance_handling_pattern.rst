Policy Resistance Handling Pattern
**********************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 When various actors try to pull a system state toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance.
 Any new policy, especially if it's effective, just pulls the system state farther from the goals of other
 actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends
 considerable effort in maintaining.

:Solution:
 Let go. Bring in all the actors and use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually
 satisfactory ways for all goal to be realized - or redefinitions of larger and more important goals
 that everyone can pull toward together.
