Shifting The Burden To The Intervenor Handling Pattern
******************************************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 Shifting the burden, dependence, and addition arise when a solution to a systemic problem reduces
 (or disguises) the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Whether it is a
 substance that dulls one´s perception or a policy that hides the underlying trouble, the drug
 of choice interferes ith the actions that could solve the real problem.
 If the intervention designed to correct the problem causes the self-maintaining capacity of the
 original system to atrophy or erode, then a destructive reinforcing feedback loop is set in motion.
 The system deteriorates; more and more of the solution is then required. The system will become
 more and more dependent on the intervention and less and less able to maintain its own desired state.

:Situation:
 Again, the best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in. Beware of symptom-relieving or
 signal-denying policies or practices that don´t really address the problem. Take the focus
 off short-term relief and put it on long-term restructuring.
 If you are the intervenor, work in such a way as to restore or enhance the system´s own ability
 to solve its problem, then remove yourself.
 If you are the the one with an unsupportable dependency, build your system´s own capabilities back
 up before removing the intervention. Do it right away. The longer you wait, the harder the withdrawal
 process will be.
