Get The Beat Of The System Pattern

 living in systems pattern

:Solution:

 - learn the systems history (graph of data over time)
 - watch the system how it behaves
  - no static, but dynamic analysis (not only "What's wrong?", but "How did we get there?")
  - no events, but behavior over different time periods
  - watch what really happens instead of listening to peoples' theories of what happens
  - be aware of "predict, control, or impose your will" mode solutions
 - analyze variable interconnections over different time periods
 - interact with the system on the basis of the past and ongoing analyzation
