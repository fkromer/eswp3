Escalation Handling Pattern
***************************

:Category:
 system trap handling pattern

:Problem:
 When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock - and vice versa -
 then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign,
 escalating loudness, escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly
 quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone's collapse - because exponential growth
 cannot go on forever.

:Situation:
 The best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in it. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to
 compete (unilaterally disarm), thereby interrupting the reinforcing loop. Or one can negotiate a new system
 with balancing feedback loops to control the escalation.
