Why principles, pattern languages and patterns?
===============================================

Lets start with the most general definition of the term "pattern language":

 "A pattern language is (at least) a collection of patterns that work together
 and admit "sequences" of patterns that solve problems larger than those of the
 individual patterns. (Bergin 2013, section "Format of a Pattern Language")"

This means that **pattern languages are a general and universal principle or
methodology for problem solving**. There does not only exist one single
problem but many others in our daily life. But the probability that someone
else has to handle ir (as the problem is reoccuring there is a need for a
pattern or language) or already has handled the problem is high. Therefore
there must exist one pattern language or one pattern to address every problem
of these.

A language suggests a sequential application of patterns dependent on

 - the situation before applying a pattern
 - the problem before applying a pattern and
 - the forces which influence which pattern of alternatives are influenced by

addresses from large-scale to small-scale patterns.

- not like other knowledge management systems (like https://www.wikipedia.org/)

 - despite of fact that wikis do relay on the same theory
 - focus on problem, not on content
 - focus on problem related referencing, not on content related referencing

- structuring of single patterns

 - situation, problem, solution, resulting situation
 - conformance with problem solution methodology
 - effective

Structuring single patterns and relating patterns with each other using pattern languages is powerful.

Pattern languages and patterns are part of the "pattern theory" (Leitner
2015, section "The concept of the pattern") developed by the architect,
systems theorist and philosopher Christopher Alexander. The pattern languages
and patterns are very practical. The basic concepts of the pattern theory are
not. **However my interpretation of the relation between pattern languages and
patterns with these basic concepts is to live a more relaxed life and beeing
able to spend more and enjoyable time with the people i love**. This makes the
pattern theory as a whole very practicable for me.

======================
A "real world" example
======================

Pattern languages and patterns are everyhwere. In most cases we apply
patterns intuitively without thinking about it. While applying it we benefit
from our experiences or information we read about a topic before. However we
do not use all the power patterns provide if selecting and thinking about it
explicitely.

The following pattern languages shall point out the existence and benefit
from it in daily life. The basic meta-data for patterns are used:
**context**, **problem**, **forces**, **solution** and **resulting context**.
To point out that pattern languages must not include only other patterns the
example proposes another (lower level) pattern language in addition to a
pattern. This makes the challenge with pattern lanuages and patterns obvious:
it is not challenging to collect and summarize patterns, but it may become
very complex to structure several of them in a pattern language. Even if the
pattern languages scope is just for a very limited context (see e.g.
**Unit Test Automation Pattern Language**).

Grocery Shopping Pattern Language
=================================

:Context:
 You need to buy some grocery.

:Problem:
 You do not know how to structure your shopping tour to get all grocery "as
 effective" as possible.

:Forces:

 - time you can spend
 - time you want spend
 - actual time -> time frame the shop is open
 - your mood (stress, relaxed)

:Solution:
 Depending on what "effective" means for you in this situation you cand apply
 on of the following **patterns in the context of buying grocery**. If you
 have much time, the store has open long enough, you want to spend much time
 
 - effective means fast: **Fast Shopper Pattern Language**
 - effective means relaxed: **Vacation Shopper Pattern**

:Resulting context:
 You have bought all grocery you required. Depending on the applyed pattern
 you eather

Vacation Grocery Shopper Pattern
--------------------------------

:Context:
 You are on vacation and need to buy some grocery.

:Problem:
 You do not like shopping (in case you are)

:Solution:
 ?

:Resulting context:
 You spend more time than required to get your grocery. But you are relaxed.
 Because you had a lot of time think about what you want you will have bought
 all the grocery required for sure.

===================
The project history
===================

From 2008 on the launcher of this website began to gain practical experience in
the context of Embedded Software Development. The first notes have been created
then and have been structured and maintained on local filesystems. From 2012 to
2014 the content has been published as ebook on the lean publishing platform
https://leanpub.com/.

From the very first the idea has been to share knowledge in an interactive,
structured, maintainable and sustainable manner. The first interactive version
of the content arose on a local testserver as WordPress implementation and has
been launched on "non-public" webhosting in 2014. Its public lauch on
http://eswkms.org followed immediatelly. In February 2015 the ESWKMS has been
migrated to TYPO3 to optimize issues regarding user management, versioning and
publication management.

After over 6 months of experimenting with TYPO3 as full-featured content
management system (CMS) its disadvantages (e.g. maintainance cost, complexity
for users, etc.) outweighed its advantages (e.g. content management mechanisms,
file management, etc.). To ensure best community interaction and a broad user
community the ESWKMS has been migrated to https://github.org for project
contribution in September 2015.

To make the project as valuable as possible the structuring of the content and
the content itself has been optimized related to "pattern languages" and
"patterns". To reflect the evolution of the project regarding the
content and its intend the project has been renamed from ESWKMS (Embedded
Software Knowledge Management System) to ESWPÂ³ (Embedded Software Principles,
Procedures and Patterns). The content is published with readthedocs.org on
http://eswp3.org. Feel free to contribute on https://github.com/fkromer/eswp3.
