Categorization of principles
============================

Many principles with it's origin in software development do not only apply in this.

* general

 * divide and conquer

* programming

 * general

  * DRY
  * KISS

 * object-oriented programming

  * DIP
  * ISP
  * OCP
  * SOLID (group of principles)

All principles in alphabetic order
==================================

Dependency inversion (DIP)
--------------------------

In contrast to the general dependency relation (high level abstraction may not dependent on low level details) regarding the modules interface low level modules may not depend on high level modules. As a result both should depend only on abstration.

Divide and conquer
------------------

This general principle eases the solution finding to a problem by breaking
it apart. This can be in a variaty of dimension (context, spartial, time, etc.).

Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
---------------------------

DRY is an acronym for "don't repeat yourself". The principle is related to the Single Responsibility principle.

Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
-----------------------------

:Synomyms: YAGNI (acronym for "You aren't gonna need it")

KISS is an acronym for "keep it simple, stupid". This principle may not be missinterpreted:
It does not mean not to design at all but to evolve the design dependend on the current requirements.

Open/closed principle (OCP)
---------------------------

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification" (Bertrand 1988)

Separation of concerns (SOC)
----------------------------

This principle is related to the structural architectural and design patterns.

Single responsibility principle (SRP)
-------------------------------------

The "single responsibility" principle is the most granular form of the "separation of concerns" principle.

SOLID
-----

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for 5 basic principles of object-oriented software design:

- Single responsibility principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed principle (OCP)
- Liskov substitution principle (LSP)
- Interface segregation principle (ISP)
- Dependency inversion principle (DIP)
